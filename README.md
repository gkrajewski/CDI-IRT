Forked from [pikrol/CDI-IRT:master](https://github.com/pikrol/CDI-IRT)

More tidying needed: some old stuff removed (maybe too quickly?) and
some still waits for removal.

The up-to-date part:
- files named `Language-CDI-WG-comp.Rmd`
- which use `Functions_new` for function definitions
- and `Data` for saving and loading various data (raw CDI, interim models, simulations)
(gitignored because of the size of `RData` files and to avoid issues with data sharing)
- and `crosslinguistic_plots.R` for... crosslinguistic plots.
